This is another version of the look command. This command will run like the

original look command with the three flags -d, -t, -f. This command will

display any lines in a file that begin with the given string. If an file is

not given, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used with the -d and -f flags

turned on. The -d flag makes it so only alphanumeric numbers are compared.

The -t flag makes it so only characters in the string up to the given

termination character are compared. The -f flag makes it so that the case 

of alphabetic characters are ignored.

To compile you only need to run make, because a Makefile is provided. This

make call should result in Look.c being compiled into Look. 

To run Look simply input "./Look [flags] [word] [file]" to the command prompt.
